# Rossman-Stores-Analysis
This project focuses on the critical data pre-processing steps used to achieve the overall goal of predicting 6 weeks of daily sales for 1,115 drug stores in Germany. We explore the data, clean it, preprocess it, and engineer new features to improve the accuracy of the sales prediction model.
